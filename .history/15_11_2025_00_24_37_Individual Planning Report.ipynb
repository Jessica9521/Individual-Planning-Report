    "To answer the question \"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\", I have decided to analyze the \"players_data\" dataset and look at how subsciption status is affected by different factors including gender, age, and experience. A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, collected the dataset analyzed in this report. The game that this dataset is about is Minecraft."
